# unity3d-advanced-grid-movement
An more advanced approach for grid based movement in Unity3d games.

In the past I wrote the https://github.com/LutzGrosshennig/unity3d-AnimatedGridMovement-Camera script which I used for my 'Xenomorph 2409' game project.

Some fellow gridders at www.dungeoncrawlers.org pointed out that the movement of that script is way to linear and yes they are right about it.
So I started to write this more advanced script that will give you more control over the movement.

#Whats new?
Fully editable animation curve for the movement
Fully editable animation curve for the head bob
Command queueing. Plan your steps in advance!
Full Unity3d project including sample level and some crappy collision detection code (just as simple showcase)
The Wall texture is taken from https://github.com/LutzGrosshennig/amiga-xeno-dungeon-crawler (be gentle to it, its 30y old Amiga pixel art).

#Usage

Should be pretty self explainatory. If you have questions create an issue and I will answer and update this readme.

#Whats next?

The code could use an refactoring. There are some dependcies and responsiblities I am not happy with. However "done!" is always better than "It will only release it when its perfect!"
Of course I will use the script in "Xenomorph 2409" as well.

#Challenge

You are not happy with the default animation curves and you found better ones? Great! Please share them with us!
